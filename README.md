# ARProsthetic
Augmented Reality Prosthetic Arm

Using the Unreal Engine 4 integrated with openCV, ARProsthetic is a prototype solution which is meant to demonstrate the attachment of a prosthetic arm model onto the user within augmented reality. Using only color detection and a simple printable colored arm band, the prosthetic arm tracks the arm of the user and gives an idea of how the prosthetic arm will look like on the user.
